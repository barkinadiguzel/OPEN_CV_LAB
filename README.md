# OPEN_CV_LAB
This repo is designed to learn computer vision with OpenCV and MediaPipe from scratch. You start with basics like images, videos, and color spaces, then move to advanced topics like pose, hand, and face tracking. Finally, you combine everything to build real-time projects like emoji display and virtual mouse control.
