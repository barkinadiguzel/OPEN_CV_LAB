# ðŸŽ¥ Vision Lab

A hands-on laboratory for learning, experimenting, and mastering the fundamentals of Computer Vision using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Python.
This repository takes you on a complete journey â€” from the pixel-level basics of how an image works, to advanced real-time applications such as gesture control, pose tracking, and motion estimation.

Whether youâ€™re just getting started or refining your skills, each section builds upon the previous one â€” guiding you through image processing, feature detection, and intelligent vision systems step by step.
The goal isnâ€™t just to use vision algorithms, but to understand how machines actually see the world.

> ðŸ’¡ Perfect for students, researchers, and curious minds who love experimenting with visual intelligence.

# ðŸ§© Note on Advanced Topics

- The last modules in the 03_advanced/ section â€”
07_camera_calibration.py, 08_pose_estimation.py, and 09_depth_estimation.py â€”
touch on concepts that are more mathematical and theoretical (camera matrices, 3D geometry, projection models, etc.).

If these feel overwhelming at first, donâ€™t get stuck â€” itâ€™s completely normal.
You can treat them as bonus explorations for later. Once youâ€™ve grasped image filtering, edge detection, and tracking, these advanced concepts will make a lot more sense.
The idea is to expose you to the depth of computer vision, not to master it all in one go.

## ðŸ§  Learning Goals

- Understand image representation and manipulation.

- Learn key OpenCV techniques (filters, transformations, thresholding).

- Explore advanced CV algorithms (edges, features, flow).

- Use MediaPipe for real-time face, hand, and pose tracking.

- Build fun, interactive projects (Virtual Mouse, Fitness Estimator, etc).
